1) KP app NOT prompting to complete verification 1st,
 instead current version only verifies when going to profile.

2) Facial recognition / biometric login was very slow when alpha tested his face.

3) Identification needs to be based by cross referencing every citizen's name in the registry that Tinkipay has access to with their rotating
3-D selfie and or government photo ID as long as the app biometrics are good enough to distinguish between a rotating 3D image versus a 2D print out.
 If that is the case the app can integrate to 3rd party verification like sumsub or other.
 Users have to be verified first through the name database and selfie before gaining access to the app.

4) Verification request is pending, please wait for approve. The last word was misspelled on the KP app , correct to approval.
OR shorten the phrase to Verification request is pending approval.
 Functionality - sending money

5) Sending and receiving money to mobile number or e-mail.
 There needs to be a way to register for this service through the kopomoni app.


6) Sending money online / paying at a store by contactless payment.
 There needs to be a way to register for contactless payments though the KP app.
  This should work without coverage or network access "offline," like with BLIK.
   How are conctactless payments activated and secured? Either through biometric ID and QR or unique 6 digit code?


7) There was a question about how to add money / deposit & cash out/ withdraw cash from a bank or bank ATM. Can money be taken out by scanning a QR code or a unique 6 digit code generated by the KM app that is integrated with the ATM.
